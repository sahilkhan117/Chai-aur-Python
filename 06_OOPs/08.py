# @property
# - make read only for a obj
# - call as a vaariable not a method without "()"

# read only attribute model

# @property is a built-in decorator that transforms a method within a class into a "property." This allows the method to be accessed and manipulated like a regular attribute, while still enabling the execution of custom logic (like validation, computation, or access control) when the attribute is accessed, modified, or deleted.
