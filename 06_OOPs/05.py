# polymorphism

# same methodes in both of the classes but that one is more appropriate or nearest can only execute 

# ðŸš€ Polymorphism in Python, derived from Greek words meaning "many forms," is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. This enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms, promoting code reusability and flexibility.
