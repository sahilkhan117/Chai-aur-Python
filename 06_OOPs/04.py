# Encapsulation
# some of the obj variables not directly acessed by obj but acssed by a Getter Methode

# Encapsulation is a concept of wrapping data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.

# ðŸŒŸ the "__brand"  > "__" shows that this is a private variable only accessed by class
